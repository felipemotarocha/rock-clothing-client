# Rock Clothing (Client Side) 👕

> Simple E-commerce application built with React and GraphQL.

I built this application to practice my React and GraphQL skills. It's a pretty simple one so the data is static and can not be changed in the client side.

# Quick Start 🚀

Install the dependencies:

```bash
    yarn install
```

Create an `.env` file in the `root` directory with the following values:

```bash
    REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5000
```

_You can change the value above if your API URL is different._

Now you can run the application with:

```bash
    yarn start
```
